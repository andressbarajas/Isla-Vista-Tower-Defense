*About Isla Vista Tower Defense*
********************************

This project is intended to be a 2 dimensional tower defense game. 
The objective of a tower defense game is to build towers that shoot 
down enemies. As towers destroy enemies the player is rewarded with 
money. Players can use the money to build more towers or upgrade 
current towers. If the player cannot keep up with the flow of 
enemies he will lose. The ultimate objective is to defend for as 
long as possible. 

The project will facilitate playing the game in that it will have 
2 dimensional graphics and intuitive game control, such as mouse 
clicking and keyboard macros. The goal will be to design an 
efficient piece of software that will run smoothly and not "lag".

Details:

This project relies heavily on codeblocks and SFML, and as a result we
were unable to create a makefile for end-user compilation.
